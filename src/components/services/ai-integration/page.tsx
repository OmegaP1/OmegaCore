            question: "Can you integrate AI with our legacy systems that have limited APIs?",
            answer: "Yes. We specialize in complex integration scenarios including legacy systems with minimal native connectivity. Our approaches include creating custom middleware, implementing screen scraping where necessary, developing dedicated data bridges, and in some cases, creating API wrappers for non-API systems."

          {
            question: "How do you handle data security during integration?",
            answer: "Security is integrated throughout our approach. We implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit, secure authentication for all connection points, data minimization principles to limit exposure, and comprehensive access controls. All integrations comply with relevant industry standards and regulations."

          {
            question: "What is the typical timeline for AI integration projects?",
            answer: "Integration timelines vary based on complexity and scope. Simple integrations with modern systems can be completed in 4-6 weeks. More complex scenarios involving multiple systems or legacy platforms typically require 3-6 months. We provide detailed timeline estimates during the assessment phase."

          {
            question: "Will integration disrupt our current operations?",
            answer: "Our integration methodology is specifically designed to minimize disruption. We use parallel implementations, staged rollouts, and careful testing to ensure business continuity. Most integrations require minimal system downtime, and critical operations can usually remain uninterrupted throughout the process."

          {
            question: "How do you ensure the integrated AI components meet our performance requirements?",
            answer: "We establish clear performance KPIs at the outset of each integration project. Our testing protocols include load testing, latency measurement, and throughput verification. Post-deployment, we implement continuous monitoring with automated alerts to detect any performance issues, and provide regular optimization to ensure ongoing compliance with your requirements."
